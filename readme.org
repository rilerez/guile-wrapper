* A set of C++ convenience classes+templates for libguile
** inspired by JeanHeyd Meneide's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejvzoifkgAI][talk on sol3]]
** scm.hpp
*** a class which can cast between the SCM datatype and primitive C/C++ datatypes
** subr.hpp
*** a set of convenience templates and macros for defining scheme primitives without having to count the number of regular, optional, rest arguments yourself. Also provides wrappers to call these idiomatically from C++ and functions to bind them in the guile environment.
** with_guile
   A wrapper on `scm_with_guile` that can take a C function object instead of just a function pointer
** list
   a variadic template to safely call the guile list-creating function
